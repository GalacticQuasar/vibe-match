## 🛠️ Codebase Overview

### Home Component

The Home component serves as the entry point of the application, welcoming users with the Vibe Match logo, title, and a login button that initiates the Spotify authentication process. Users are redirected to the Spotify authentication page, where they can log in and allow the application access to their Spotify data.

### Authentication Handler

The authentication handler manages the Spotify login flow by receiving an authorization code upon successful login. It exchanges this code for an access token, which allows the application to access the user's Spotify data securely. After obtaining the token, users are redirected to the tracks page to start exploring their musical journey.
